    <div class=page2><h1>What is coronavirus?</h1>
     <p style="color:black;font-size:50px;">Coronaviruses are a group of related RNA viruses that cause diseases in mammals
         and birds. In humans and birds, they cause respiratory tract infections that
          can range from mild to lethal. <br>
         Mild illnesses in humans include some cases of the common cold (which is also
          caused by other viruses, predominantly rhinoviruses), while more lethal varieties 
          can cause SARS, MERS, and COVID-19.<br>
          In cows and pigs they cause diarrhea, while in mice they cause hepatitis and 
          encephalomyelitis.<br>
        Coronaviruses constitute the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, in the family Coronaviridae,
         order Nidovirales, and realm Riboviria.<br>
        They are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome and a
         nucleocapsid of helical symmetry.The genome size of coronaviruses ranges from 
         approximately 26 to 32 kilobases, one of the largest among RNA viruses.They have 
         characteristic club-shaped spikes that project from their surface, which in electron 
         micrographs create an image reminiscent of the solar corona, from which their name 
         derives.</p>

        <h1>What is Covid-19?</h1>
        <p style="color:black;font-size:50px;">2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease, designated 
            as novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) 
            by China, and designated as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the WHO, is an

             infectious respiratory disease caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), first
              detected during the 2019-20 Wuhan coronavirus outbreak.
              COVID-19 is a new strain of coronavirus that has not been previously identified in humans. 
              The COVID-19 is the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness first detected in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.

             Since December 2019, cases have been identified in a growing number of countries. 
              The District’s surveillance data can be found here.
              
              Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are known to cause illness 
              ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Severe Acute
               Respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).</p>

       <h1>PREVENTION</h1>
       <p>Use warm water and soap and rub your hands for at least 20 seconds. Work the lather to your 
           wrists, between your fingers, and under your fingernails. You can also use an antibacterial
            and antiviral soap.<br>
            Avoid touching any part of your face or head, including your mouth, nose, and eyes. 
            Also avoid biting your fingernails. This can give SARS-CoV-2 a chance to go from your hands into your body.<br>
            Similarly, avoid touching other people. Skin-to-skin contact can transmit SARS-CoV-2 from one person to another.<br>
            Clean your phone, laptop, and anything else you use regularly several times a day.

            Disinfect areas after you bring groceries or packages into your home.
            
            Use white vinegar or hydrogen peroxide solutions for general cleaning in between disinfecting surfaces.</p>

   </div>
   <div class=img4></div>
   <div class=page5><h1>PHYSICAL DISTANCING</h1>
<p>If you’re carrying the SARS-CoV-2 virus, it’ll be found in high amounts in your spit (sputum). This can happen even if 
    you don’t have symptoms.
    Physical (social) distancing, also means staying
     home and working remotely when possible.
    If you must go out for necessities, keep a distance of 6 feet (2 m) from
     other people. You can transmit the virus by speaking to someone in close 
     contact to you.</p>
</div>
   <div class=img5></div>
   <div class=page6><h1>FACE MASK AND HYGIENE</h1>
    <P>Wearing a mask alone will not prevent you from getting a SARS-CoV-2 infection.
        Careful handwashing and physical distancing must also be followed.<br>   
        Cloth masks aren’t as effective as other types of masks, such as surgical masks or N95 respirators.
         However, these other masks should be reserved for healthcare workers and first responders.<br>
         You can transfer the virus from your hands to the mask. If you’re wearing a mask, avoid touching the front of it.<br>
         A mask shouldn’t be worn by a child under 2 years old, a person who has trouble breathing, or a person who can’t remove
          the mask on their own.</P></div>
